# Frankenstein's Telephone

Chained together hosted models from RunwayML. This is the stripped down source code showing how the models work together and may be handy for others. This is unstyled and designed for you to insert your own URL data, styling and to use as an example of chained RunwayML hosted models.

This will not run as it is, it needs the hosted URL information.
To run this code clone it and host the models in RunwayML and insert your unique URL every place where it says YourUrlGoesHere.

*Known Issues*
Image exif rotation is a periodic problem in the image upload. I am working on a baked in rotation solution but it is being very pesky.
Text entry doesnt work in iOS. - literally no idea why.
